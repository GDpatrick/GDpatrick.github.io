I am currently serving as a PIMS-CNRS Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada. My research is deeply rooted in applied mathematics and High-Performance Computing, using highly-resolved numerical methods for numerical investigation of multi-phase flows. The scope of my research is diverse, encompassing various domains such as the deformation of blood cells, the dynamics of solid angular particles in inertial flow, and droplet interactions with compressible flow, such as shock waves.

Biological flows
======
Iâ€™m currently working on the development of a front-tracking solver. We describe the deformable capsules using an unstructured lagrangian mesh and compute the internal strains and stresses of the membrane. These stresses are transferred to the fluid with the Immersed Boundary Method (IBM), i.e. by means of a regularized Dirac function.

Many of the features of dynamic content management systems (like Wordpress) can be achieved in this fashion, using a fraction of the computational resources and with far less vulnerability to hacking and DDoSing. You can also modify the theme to your heart's content without touching the content of your site. If you get to a point where you've broken something in Jekyll/HTML/CSS beyond repair, your markdown files describing your talks, publications, etc. are safe. You can rollback the changes or even delete the repository and start over -- just be sure to save the markdown files! Finally, you can also write scripts that process the structured data on the site, such as [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb) that analyzes metadata in pages about talks to display [a map of every location you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html).
